		 My name is Julia Grace and I am a sophomore in the Tufts University School of Engineering majoring in Computer Science. Outside the classroom at Tufts, I am also a member of Tufts JumboCode, a student-run organization dedicatated to helping local and national non-profits with their software development needs. Last semester, my team created a web application survey for where Tufts students could be matched with different community service projects based on factors such as availability and area of interest. This semester, my team will be working for the Boston Harbor Islands to increase awarness of their shuttle schedule by working with the goople maps api to improve the BHI's website. At Tufts, I am also a member of the Varsity Crew Team. On average, I spend about 14 hours training with the crew team per week. Additionally, I am a tour guide for the Tufts Admissions Office. In the future I would like to be a software engineer and work on projects that contribute to the greater good.
